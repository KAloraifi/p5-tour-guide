## Project 5: Tour Guide App
### The goal is to create a Tour Guide App which presents relevant information to a user who’s visiting your city.
This app is a tour guide app for Riyadh city in Saudi Arabia. It displays famous museums, mosques, malls, and parks. When the user clicks on a location, they are taken to a map app that would pinpoint that location.
